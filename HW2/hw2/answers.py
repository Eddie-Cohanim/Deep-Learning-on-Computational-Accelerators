# Part 1 (Backprop) answers

**Answer 1:**$\\$
The shape of the resulting tensor is ${R}^{64x512x64x1024}$.

**Answer 2:**$\\$
Since the Jacobian matrix will be a block matrix of NxN, where each
block is 1024x512, we can index the samples using n,m such that the
block(n,m) is the jacobian matrix of the output of sample n over the
input of sample m, $\frac{\partial Y^{(n)}}{\partial X^{(m)}}$. and since the linear layers act independently
per sample we get:
$${Y}^{n}=W*{X}^{n}$$

now we shall look at 2 differenct cases:$\\$
$\hspace{2em}$ **i**. $n \neq m$ : 
$$\frac{\partial Y^{(n)}}{\partial X^{(m)}} = 0$$
$\hspace{4em}$ Which means there is no dependence between samples.$\\$

$\hspace{2em}$ **ii**. $n = m$ :
$$\frac{\partial Y^{(n)}}{\partial X^{(m)}} = W$$
$\hspace{4em}$ Which means that we get the same linear map for every
sample.$\\$

Therefore, The block matrix is block diagonal with N identical
diagonal blocks equal to W and all off diagonal blocks equal zero.

**Answer 3:**$\\$
Since the Jacobian matrix is constructed from blocks on the diagonal
that are W, with all other blocks equaling 0, there is no need to
construct the whole matrix, instead we can just construct the non zero
elemnts in the matrix, which is the blocks on the diagonal, and since
they are all W we only need W once, which is the shape of
${R}^{512x1024}$

**Answer 4:**$\\$
beacuse the Jacobian matrix is block diagonal with W equaling the blocks,
we can calculate the downstream gradient using the chain rule.$\\$
For each sample we get:
$$y = Wx $$ $$\frac{\partial Y}{\partial X} = W$$ 

Therefor we get:
$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial x} = (\frac{\partial y}{\partial x})^{\top} \frac{\partial L}{\partial y}
 = W^{\top}\delta y$$
Which leads to:
$$\delta X = \delta YW$$

**Answer 5:**$\\$
When differntiating, we get that 
$\frac{\partial {Y}_{n,m}}{\partial {W}_{k,i}}$ equals either ${X}_{n,i}$ when
$k = m$ **or** $0$ otherwise$\\$
Therefore, the JAcobian matrix in non zero only along the output dimension diagonal and its
shape is: 
$$R^{64x512x512x1024}$$
with each$(m,k)$ slice forming an $(512x1024)$ block.

**Answer:**$\\$
the second order derivative can be useful, such as when the loss landscape is curved very
differently along different directions(flat in one direction but very steep in another) will
cause the gradient descent to take small, slow steps. using the second order derivative will
allow the optimizer to take large steps in flat directions and small steps in steeper ones,
leading to faster convergance.
